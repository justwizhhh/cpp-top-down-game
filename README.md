# Pocket Adventure - A C++ Top-down Adventure Game (ARCHIVE)

A short top-down adventure game, fusing mechanics of The Legend of Zelda with Pool (the cue-sports game), featuring multiple rooms with dynamic object and tile loading, bouncing pool-ball physics, enemies with varying behaviours and pathfinding, smart pointers, and threading functionality.

Made in ~3 months for a university assignment submission, as part of the "More Games in C++' module at UWE Bristol (BSc Games Technology).

Last commit pushed on April 3rd 2025.
